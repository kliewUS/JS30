    let age = 100; //Value of age goes into the variable at the same time. Hence, age changes, but not age2. Also applies to strings.
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    //If you change the original, it won't change the other name.


    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    console.log(players, team);

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'Bob';
    console.log(team, team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // console.log(person, captain);
    // captain.number = 99;
    // console.log(person, captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 81, age: 14});
    console.log(person, cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person}; - Not in JS yet.

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const kel = {
      name: 'kelvin',
      age: 100,
      social: {

    const dev = Object.assign({}, kel, {name: 'Kel'})
    console.log(kel, dev);
    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman'; //Will also change the original.

    console.log(kel, dev);

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(kel)); //Not Recommended - Will turn it into a string and back as a new object.
